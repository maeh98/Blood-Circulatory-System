# Blood-Circulatory-System

University Group Project in partnership with the High Performance Computing Centre Stuttgart (HLRS).
Project Title: Modelling and Numerical Solution of the Blood Circulatory System.
Creators: Berlinski Tomer, Costa Beatrice, Ehrlich Manuel & Moral Sánchez Elena.
Matlab simulation (all the code in this repository) by Ehrlich Manuel & Moral Sánchez Elena.

The model is a compartmental model with a focus on the heart valves resulting in a system of ODEs. The system was solved numerically on Matlab using appropriately modified adaptive Range-Kutta methods. One of the challenges was to deal with non-differentiable points in the right hand side of the ODE.

The presentation and the poster attached were presented towards (but before) the end of our work. The report contains all our work. The Matlab code in the repository allows one to reproduce a simulation of a blood circulatory system model.
